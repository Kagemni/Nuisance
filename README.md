# Overview

Nuisance is a fun hack where the presence of a phone, or object, is detected using a force sensor. Once detected, our lovable friend embarks on an adventure in a game of keepaway. However, there's a catch. 
This isn't your normal game of keepaway. If daring enough to approach, Nuisance will scream, elliciting sounds of horror
